### [Quantum Bayesian Inference](AM_thesis.qmd)

**科技部大專生研究計畫** (NSTC 112-2813-C-005-038-E)

Investigated whether quantum computer outputs conform to Bayesian probability laws. Developed Qiskit programs on IBMQ hardware and simulators to test the law of large numbers, revealing divergence between actual quantum runs and simulator predictions.

**Tools:** Python, Qiskit, IBMQ (ibm_osaka), Bayesian Updating, matplotlib
